		<h2>What This Website Is All About?</h2>
		<p>
			The website - Gandhi: The Legend has been made by me (Zaid Ahmad), a student of class 9 as displayed at the bottom of the page. The image at the title bar as well as the background image have been created using the all time powerful photo editor, Photoshop (version: CS6).

			I tried my best to revolve around the theme i.e. Gandhi and the modern India. In the webpage, I first gave a brief description about M.K Gandhi, then told you about his evergreen values. After showing you with those things, I drew a contrast of the old india to the present new india. I also mentioned the way India changed after losing one of the strongest leaders of all time in the Indian history. The images I displayed show how dirty the politics has become. The image showing famous social media platforms shows how bounded we have become to the social media and how enthusiastic we are while boasting about our daily lives. M.K gandhi never-ever boasted about his position, success. Finally, I presented you about how people today feel about Gandi's values in this modern India.
