                    He was an Indian lawyer,  anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British Rule and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.

                    Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India, Gandhi was trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, and called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to stay for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family, and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India. He set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, build religious and ethnic amity, end untouchability, and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.

                    <h3>Self-belief</h3>
                    <p>Believe in what you do and never change your mind even if no one stands by you. There are myriad options available and so many naysayers but don't let that stop you. Your conviction is the only thing you need to achieve your dreams and help pull you together when the times are tough.</p>

                    <h3>Integrity</h3>
                    <p>There will be many attractive options that will lure you away but never do things that you will not be proud of or those that you will regret later. Integrity comes from the congruence of thoughts, feelings, words, and actions-when all that you are and do spring from your core values. Gandhiji was one of the greatest examples of integrity we have seen in modern times</p>

                <div class="card3 animate">
                    <h3>Respect for all</h3>
                    <p>I think people today need to understand this value the most. In a country like India where there is so much social and economic discrimination we definitely need our 0nation to understand that everybody is equal and they all deserve respect. Money isn’t the only factor that gets you respect. Each individual commands respect and it is only fair to give it to them.</p>

                    <h3>Leadership</h3>
                    <p>He was by far one of the strongest and most powerful leaders the country has ever seen. Some qualities that are much needed in today’s corporate, social and political environment. A leader with a single vision, clear focus and one who wasn't crazy for power.</p>

                    <h3>Simplicity & Humility</h3>
                    <p>The legend won the hearts of citizens and followers with his simplicity. No unnecessary publicity, no glamour, no money play just mutual respect. Inspite of being in a position of power he was humble and kind.</p>

	        			In contrast to modern India,  all these values are not followed by everyone. Even if people try to inculcate these values, they unconsciously lose their path as a result of which they return back to their old self. If we look closely,  we would observe that this India is completely different from the old India. It is good from one end but is rusting out from the other end. Here is a deep explanation below so you can understand what we are trying to say.

		        		The modern India is more about boasting about one's values rather than valuing them. The social media (for example) is a place made only for the wastage of time. We are all bounded by them. In addition to this, the nation's political leaders are perfect examples of people with dishonesty, they do have self-belief but do not have respect for anyone. They gain leadership from making fake promises. They are not transparent, they showcase their work once it's done rather than improving it even more.

		        		The teachings of Mahatma Gandhi for maintaining peace, harmony and non-violence are extremely relevant and important in the modern-day society, where we are seeing a rising trend of people resorting to violence in addressing their issues and conflicts are seen. If people continue to be like this, this mother earth shall be a hell.

                                        There are those who hail him as the Father of India and try to draw direct causal connexions between his ideals and many of the major changes which have occurred in India since 1947, particularly the official abolition of Untouchability and the institution of panchayat raj. But this is from our prespective. It underrates the complexities of politics and society and their interaction, and turns a blind eye to the innumerable cross currents which make up the main stream of Indian social and political activity.

                                    There are those who dismiss him, often regretfully, as an idealist whose Utopian plans for a democracy of village commonwealths and a non-violent society have collapsed in the face of economic and political necessity and the machinations of unscrupulous politicians. In the words of Jayaprakash Narayan, ‘If you consider the political ideologies attaining in India today, you would find that somehow one who is called the Father of the Nation is completely missing from all of them’. Such pessimism assesses Gandhi as if he had been solely a dispenser of blue-prints for a brave new world, and fails to see him as a dynamic leader whose greatest influence flowed from the type of movement he led and the techniques he used, rather than from the peculiarly personal ideals he held.
